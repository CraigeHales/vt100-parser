Differences from xterm
======================

DECAWM
------

In xterm (version 256, at least), characters written at the end of the line
when DECAWM is reset do *not* overwrite the last character.  In
gnome-terminal, they do.  The latter seems to be correct, so that is what
is implemented.

CBT
---

Xterm handles CBT when the cursor is past the end of the line in a very
strange manner: If CBT is followed by an output character, the output goes on
the next line as though no CBT occurred.  However, if CBT is followed by
something like RI that "clips" the cursor and then an output character, the
CBT behaves like normal.  Also, xterm's CBT ignores a tab stop that is set in
the rightmost column when the cursor is past the end of the line

Gnome-terminal implements what seems more sane: the cursor is one past the
rightmost column, and a tab stop in the rightmost column is honored.  However,
gnome-terminal ignores the argument to CBT.

We choose to implement gnome-terminal's end-of-line behavior but also
honor the argument to CBT.
