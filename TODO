Testing
=======

* 10-19: ESC quirks, CSI quirks
* 30-39: CHA, HPA, VPA
* 40-49: RIS
* 50-59: DECSEL, DECSED
* 70-79: HT, HTS, CHT, CBT, TBC
* 80-99: modes
* 100+: DCS, SOS, OSC, PM, APC
* 200+: SGR

* test HTML output (new framework needed?)


Commands To Implement
=====================

* Modes: IRM, LNM, DECCOLM, DECSCNM, DECOM, DECAWM, reverse wraparound
* Reset: DECSTR
* DEC Rectangular Area: CECCARA, DECRARA
* OSC command to configure the 256 xterm colors.
* Alternate fonts / character sets?


Options
=======

* 8-bit mode?
* 88- vs 256-color
* 8-color vs 16-color
* Non xterm?
* Ability to print alternative screen buffer


Output
======

* 'inverse' attribute for HTML

* Xterm keeps track of long lines so that you can select wrapped lines as a
  single line.  This is not possible for text output, but it might be in HTML.
  It is possible to set the ``pre``\ 's style to wrap using the following::

    pre {
    white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; /* Mozilla, supported since 1999 */
    white-space: -pre-wrap; /* Opera 4 - 6 */
    white-space: -o-pre-wrap; /* Opera 7 */
    white-space: pre-wrap; /* CSS3 - Text module (Candidate Recommendation) */
    word-wrap: break-word; /* IE 5.5+ */
    }

  However, I'm not sure how to specify that there should be exactly 80 (or
  whatever) columns.  Also, this would require some tracking of wrapping.


Miscellaneous
=============

* Implement custom screen object to remove dependence on Numpy.
